# Gnosticism: The True Catholicism

If you have ever studied religion, you may know that the word "catholic" means "universal," as in, the catholic faith is the universally applicable faith. If you have studied Roman Catholicism to any extent, though, you may find this difficult to believe. The many doctrines that Roman Catholics are required to follow leave it feeling like it's anything but universal. This, then, leads to another question: what _is_ the universal faith? Does it even exist?

Before going any further, it is worth noting that a lot of the terminology in this article can be understood in many ways. You will find a glossary at the end of this article, before the bibliography, for the working definitions of some of the terms used throughout. It may be useful to skim this glossary before reading any further.

Naturally, one might be tempted to provide the seemingly obvious answer of Unitarian Universalism but this is equally unsuitable. In order for a religion to be truly universal, it must be **inclusive** of all other religions. Unitarian Universalism, like Roman Catholicism, only **replaces** the doctrines of one faith with its own. Furthermore, it being outside the scope of this study, we will say nothing of the watered-down eclecticism that is lazily passed off as "universalism" among the Unitarian Universalists.

## The Metareligious Philosophy of Gnosticism

Gnosticism is unique among the world's religions, first and foremost, in that it is not really a religion in the traditional sense; instead, it might better be thought of as a meta religion. Where religions have traditionally diverged from one another in dogma and theology, Gnosticism approaches spirituality in such a way that it is _beyond_ any one doctrine of either.
